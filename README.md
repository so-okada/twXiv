# Application Info

This application twXiv gives arXiv daily new submissions by tweets. 
We use python3 scripts. twXiv is not affiliated with arXiv.


## Setup

* Install pandas, ratelimit, tweepy, twitter-text-parser, nameparser, and feedparser.

	```
	% pip3 install pandas ratelimit tweepy twitter-text-parser nameparser feedparser 
	```

* Let twXiv.py be executable.
 
	 ```
	 % chmod +x twXiv.py
	 ```

*  Put the following python scripts in the same directory.

	- twXiv.py
	- twXiv_post.py 	
	- twXiv_format.py
	- twXiv_daily_feed.py 	
	- arXiv_feed_parser.py
	- twXiv_variables.py


* Configure switches.json, logfiles.json, and aliases.json in the
  tests directory for your settings.

	- accesses.json specifies twitter access keys and whether to put
	new submissions for each category.

    - logfiles.json indicates log file locations for tweet summaries
	and tweets. In the tests/logfiles director, you have the sample
	log files mathACb_tweet_summaries.csv and mathACb_tweets.csv.
		
	- aliases.json tells twXiv aliases of arXiv category names.  For
    example, math.IT is an alias of cs.IT.  If provided, twXiv
    replaces category names by their aliases.
	
* Configure twXiv_variables.py for your settings. 

   - twXiv_variables.py assigns format parameters for twXiv tweets 
   and access frequencies for arXiv and twitter.

## Notes

* arXiv_feed_parser.py is a simple arXiv feed parser for twXiv. We
  use this via twXiv_daily_feed.py to regularly obtain data. 
	
* Outputs of twXiv can differ from arXiv new submission web
  pages. First, this can be due to bugs in my scripts or connection
  errors.  Second, items of arXiv rss feeds are not necessarily the
  same as those of arXiv new submission web pages (see
  https://mastoxiv.page/@vela/109829294232368163).  Third,
  arXiv_feed_parser for an arXiv category C gives new submissions
  whose primary subjects are the category C.  Then, twXiv for the
  category C counts and tweets a new paper whose principal subject
  matches the category C.

	- For example, let us assume that there is no new paper whose
	principal subject matches the category C, but there is a new paper
	P whose non-principal subject matches the category C. Then, the
	arXiv new submission web page of the category C lists the paper P
	as a new submission of the category C, not as a cross-list.
	However, twXiv keeps considering the paper P as a cross-list for
	the category C.  Then, the output of twXiv for the category C
	differs from the arXiv new submission web page of the category C.
	One reason for this is to clarify what twXiv tweets across
	categories.  Another reason is that twitter does not like
	duplicate or substantially similar tweets for bots.


* On the use of metadata of arXiv articles, there is the web page of
   [Terms of Use for arXiv APIs](https://arxiv.org/help/api/tou). 
   This says that "You are free to use descriptive
   metadata about arXiv e-prints under the terms of the Creative
   Commons Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Declaration." and
   "Descriptive metadata includes information for discovery and
   identification purposes, and includes fields such as title,
   abstract, authors, identifiers, and classification terms."

## Author
So Okada, so.okada@gmail.com, https://so-okada.github.io/

## Motivation

Since 2013-04, the author has been running the bots above
 for all arXiv math categories.  Until 2020-08, the author
 used arxiv_speaker
 [https://github.com/misho104-obsolete/arxiv_speaker](https://github.com/misho104-obsolete/arxiv_speaker). Sho
 Iwamoto wrote it by ruby for tweeting new submissions with
 titles, authors, and ids.  However, it was
 discontinued.  Therefore, the author has
 written twXiv by python3, adding functions such as
 abstracts by replies, cross-lists by retweets, and
 replacements by quotes and retweets. 
Since 2020-08, the
 bots above have used twXiv on gcp free tier.
 Since 2025-01, the author has 
 added the function of  two-new-submissions-in-one-tweet
 and abondoned
 the functions of abstracts, cross-lists, and replacements
 for the limitations of  X api free tire.
